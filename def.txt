
A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing an array of data (of any
NumPy data type) and an associated array of data labels, called its index.
A DataFrame represents a tabular, spreadsheet-like data structure containing an ordered
collection of columns, each of which can be a different value type (numeric,
string, boolean, etc.). The DataFrame has both a row and column index; it can be
thought of as a dict of Series (one for all sharing the same index).
